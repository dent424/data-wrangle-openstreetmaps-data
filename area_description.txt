The data that I selected was from the Kansas City, Lawrence, Topeka Kansas area.

This area covers a corridor from Kansas City, which straddles Missouri and Kansas, west to Topeka, the state Capital.

The URL for the data was:

I selected this region because I have spent a lot of time in Lawrence, Kansas, as my paternal grandparents lived there.
